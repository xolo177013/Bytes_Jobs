## 📖 About

Bytes Jobs is a full-stack recruitment platform with two sides: a **candidate
experience** (browse jobs, apply, track applications, get AI-ranked job
matches) and a **recruiter experience** (post jobs, manage an applicant
pipeline through structured interview rounds, source candidates directly,
and collaborate as a team). The core of the project — and its academic
contribution — is the matching engine, which combines classic
information-retrieval techniques with structured candidate/job compatibility
signals to produce ranked, *explainable* matches rather than an opaque score.

It's built with production-shaped concerns in mind, not just a tutorial demo:
JWT authentication via httpOnly cookies, role-based authorization scoped to
recruiting teams, rate limiting and account lockout, a CI pipeline that runs
the full test suite and a security scan on every push, and a documented,
signal-driven caching layer for the matching corpus.

## ✨ Features

**For candidates**
- Browse and filter jobs by location, salary, work mode, experience level, and job type
- AI-ranked **"Matches for you"** with a transparent breakdown — which required skills matched (including common synonyms like JS/JavaScript or k8s/Kubernetes), which are missing, and whether location, experience level, job type, and salary actually line up
- Apply with a cover letter and CV upload (PDF/DOCX text extraction feeds directly into matching)
- Track every application through a full pipeline — *Pending → Reviewing → Shortlisted → Interview → Offered → Hired* (or Rejected / Offer Declined / Withdrawn) — with a visible status-change history timeline
- See your own structured interview schedule (round type, date, outcome) as a recruiter adds rounds
- Save jobs, manage your profile including job-type preferences, and delete your account and all associated data on request

**For recruiters**
- Post, edit, pause, and delete job listings
- Review applicants with full profile access, CV download, private notes, and a structured rejection-reason flow
- Run applicants through **multi-round structured interviews** — add rounds (screen/technical/onsite/final), assign an interviewer, record a private 1–5 scorecard and feedback, and set a pass/fail outcome per round
- Move applicants through the pipeline individually or in bulk, with every transition validated against a real state machine (no marking someone "Hired" who was never "Offered")
- **Source candidates directly** — paginated search across every candidate who's opted in to being discovered, not just inbound applicants
- **Work as a team** — create or join a company via a shareable join code; every recruiter on the same team can view, edit, and manage each other's job postings and applicants, with clear attribution of who originally posted each job
- Dashboard stats: active jobs, total applications, pipeline breakdown — automatically covering the whole team's jobs once you're on one

**Platform**
- Role-based access control (candidate / recruiter), enforced server-side on every endpoint — never just a client-side route guard
- Team-based job access via a single reusable `Job.objects.manageable_by(user)` query, so permission logic can't drift out of sync between endpoints
- JWT auth delivered via httpOnly, `SameSite=Lax` cookies (not readable by JS, mitigating XSS token theft)
- Rate limiting and brute-force lockout (`django-axes`) on auth endpoints
- Cached matching corpus with signal-driven invalidation (no stale scores after a profile or job edit)
- 160+ automated backend tests + ESLint-clean, production-building frontend, enforced in CI

## 🧠 How the Matching Engine Works

Most "AI matching" job boards stop at keyword overlap. Bytes Jobs's engine
(`backend/matching/engine.py`) combines two layers:

1. **Text similarity** — a TF-IDF vectorizer fit over job descriptions and
   candidate profiles/CVs, scored by cosine similarity. This is the
   classic information-retrieval half: it rewards distinctive shared
   vocabulary ("Kubernetes", "PostgreSQL") and downweights common words.
2. **Structured compatibility signals** — computed directly from fields a
   pure-text approach ignores entirely:
   - Skills overlap, with a curated synonym map so "JS" matches "JavaScript",
     "k8s" matches "Kubernetes", "AWS" matches "Amazon Web Services", etc.
     (not exhaustive, not ML-based — a maintained list of common real-world
     aliases; see `SKILL_SYNONYMS` in `matching/engine.py`)
   - Location / work-mode compatibility (remote jobs are always compatible)
   - Experience-level fit (years-of-experience banded against the job's stated level)
   - Job-type compatibility (full-time/part-time/contract/freelance/internship)
   - Salary range overlap

The layers combine into a single 0–100 score:

| Component | Weight |
|---|---|
| Text similarity | 40% |
| Skills overlap | 25% |
| Location compatibility | 15% |
| Experience-level fit | 10% |
| Job-type compatibility | 5% |
| Salary overlap | 5% |

Every match returns *why* it scored the way it did (`matched_skills`,
`missing_skills`, `location_compatible`, `experience_fit`,
`job_type_compatible`, `salary_compatible`) — surfaced directly in the UI —
rather than a bare, unexplained percentage. The TF-IDF corpus is cached and
invalidated via Django signals whenever a job or profile changes, so the
expensive vectorizer fit isn't repeated on every request while still never
serving a stale corpus.

## 👥 Team-Based Recruiting

Recruiters aren't limited to working solo. Any recruiter can create a
Company (getting a shareable join code back) or join one a teammate already
created. Once on the same team:

- Every job posted by any teammate becomes visible and manageable to the
  whole team — view applicants, move them through the pipeline, add
  interview rounds, edit or pause the listing
- The job list and dashboard stats automatically expand to cover the whole
  team's jobs, not just your own
- Each job clearly shows who actually posted it, so shared visibility never
  means losing track of ownership
- Leaving a team is a single action and immediately reverts you to
  solo-recruiter visibility — nothing is deleted, and you can rejoin later
  with the same code

This is implemented as a single reusable access rule
(`Job.objects.manageable_by(user)`) rather than duplicated permission checks
scattered across endpoints, specifically to prevent team-access logic from
drifting out of sync between different parts of the API over time.

| `jobs` | Job postings, filtering, saved jobs, team-based access rules |
| `applications` | The application pipeline, status transitions, interview rounds, bulk actions |
| `matching` | The scoring engine — no models of its own, just logic other apps call into |

## 🚀 Getting Started

>>>>>>> Stashed changes
### Option A — Docker Compose (recommended)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ahmedabbas52233-a11y/Bytes Jobs-Job-Portal.git
cd Bytes Jobs-Job-Portal
docker compose up --build
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:8000` and the frontend at
`http://localhost:5173` (or `http://localhost` for the production compose
profile, served via Nginx).

### Option B — Manual setup

**Backend**

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate          # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env               # fill in your own SECRET_KEY and DB credentials
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py seed_jobs         # optional — seeds demo jobs and accounts
python manage.py runserver
```

**Frontend**

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
cp .env.example .env
npm run dev
```

### Demo accounts

After running `seed_jobs`, every seeded account uses the password `BytesJobs#26`. For
example:

| Email | Role |
|---|---|
| `testcandidate@gmail.com` | Candidate (Data Scientist — strong AI match demo) |

See `backend/jobs/management/commands/seed_jobs.py` for the full list.

## 🧪 Running Tests

```bash
# Backend
cd backend
python manage.py test

# Frontend
cd frontend
npm run lint
npm run build
```

CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs the Django test suite, a
`makemigrations --check` drift guard, a security scan, ESLint, and a
production build on every push — see badge above.

## 📚 API Documentation

Interactive API docs are auto-generated via `drf-spectacular` once the
backend is running:

- Swagger UI: `http://localhost:8000/api/schema/swagger-ui/`
- ReDoc: `http://localhost:8000/api/schema/redoc/`
- Raw OpenAPI schema: `http://localhost:8000/api/schema/`

## 🔒 Security

See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for the project's security policy and how to
report a vulnerability. Notable design choices: JWT delivered via httpOnly
cookies (not `localStorage`, to limit XSS blast radius), `SameSite=Lax`
cookie scoping, server-side role and team-membership checks on every
endpoint (never just a client-side route guard), and rate-limited/
lockout-protected auth endpoints.
