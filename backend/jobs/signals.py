"""
Job alerts: when a recruiter posts a new active job, email every candidate
whose profile matches above the threshold score.

Runs synchronously (no Celery required). With Celery this would be
`notify_matching_candidates.delay(job.id)`.

Also invalidates the matching engine's cached job corpus on any Job change,
so candidate match scores never reflect a stale job list.
